# Notes

## Me

A mobile web developer working for Fairfax.

## Humble goals

Short overview of Sencha Touch framework.

* Do you need ST for your next project?


## Mobile vs Desktop

* touch + small screen -> different UX patterns
* performance: rendering, memory and network
* different environments -> browser vs native wrapper

## Mobile Libraries & Frameworks

* Sencha Touch
* jQuery + jQuery Mobile + Backbone.js
* Zepto.js + Backbone.js
* Micro libraries like iScroll
* ...

##  Why Sencha Touch Rocks? (What Sencha Touch gives you?)

* class system - classes, inheritance and mixins, dependency management
* MVC and application structure
* rich set of standard components
* utils - DOM, Selectors, Templates etc
* tool chain - scaffolds, build, deployment
* theming framework

## Why Sencha Touch Sucks?

* complex - learning curve is high especially for frontend developers
* heavy

## How to Study

* tutorial + videos
* samples - KitchenSink
* API documentation
* Source code - not on GitHub
* Forum

## Add More Coffeine

Using CoffeeScript with ST.
