# Sencha Touch + Your Next Project === Love?

## Introduction

> slide

Hey, my name is Valery. 
I am a JavaScript developer like many of you here.
At the end of the last year
I had a chance to try how mobile web development looks like
and now I would love to share some of these findings with you.
During next 10 minutes I will give you a short overview of
Sencha Touch JavaScript framework.

In Fairfax, the company where I work,
*some not particularly technical people* call me a 'Sencha developer'.
It sounds ridiculous, in the same way one can address a carpenter
as a 'hammer operator'.

What I am trying to convey here is that a framework or library
is just a **tool** to make your job done.
Hopefully, starting a shiny new project you have a **choice**
which particular tool to pick up.

In the real word, nothing is ideal, so even the best tools have its pros and cons.
What is a great for one task or project can be terrible for another.
I am telling these trivial things to you just for one simple reason.
Considering new, shiny and professionally marketed technology
we need to have rigth attitude to have real **choice**
but not just follow the herd.

OK, let move on.

## Mobile vs Desktop

> slide

First of all lets take a look how mobile world is different
from good old desktop which is familiar to everyone.

* touch, gestures and small screen -> different UX patterns
* performance
  * execution is slow
  * memory is scarce
  * 3G network is sluggish
* WebKit dominated browser landscape
  We are lucky here, it's mainly WebKit browsers.
  Well, there is Windows Phone on the horizon
  with astonishing less than 1% market share in Australia.

## Mobile Libraries & Frameworks

> slide

Now lets take a look which libraries are here to make our life easier.

* Sencha Touch
* jQuery + jQuery Mobile + ...
* Zepto.js + ...
* Micro libraries like iScroll
* ...

This list is sorted from top to bottom by amount of features that libraries provide.
Obviously nothing comes without price so library's size increases in the same order.

##  Why Sencha Touch Rocks?

Class System and MVC

  * inheritance, mixins, statics, singleton
  * automatic dependency management
  * standart application architecture
  * declarative selector based event binding
  * deep linking support (routing)

Rich Set of Components

  * lists and forms - look and feel close to native
  * toolbars, buttons and icons
  * tabs, carousel and overlays
  * awesome charts (separate component)

And More Goodness

* Core utils: DOM, selectors, platform detection, templates etc
* themes based on SASS and Compass
* command line tools: scaffolds, build & packaging

## Why Sencha Touch Sucks?

> slide

* supports only iOS, Android and Blackberry at the moment
* complex: learning curve can be high
* heavy: for example 420/142Kb - JS, 133/65Kb - CSS
* not on GitHub

## How to Study
