Sencha Touch + Your Next Project === Love?

## Introduction

> slide

Hi, my name is Valery. 
I am JavaScript developer like many of you.
A half a year ago I decided to find out how mobile web development looks like
and now I would like to share some of this findings with you.

In Fairfax, the company where I work,
some not particularly technical people call me a 'Sencha developer'.
It sounds ridiculous, in the same way one can address a carpenter as a 'hammer operator'.
What I am trying to convey is that a framework or library
is just a tool to make your job done.

Starting a new project you hopefully have a choice which tools to pick up.
Lets try to find out weather you need Sencha Touch and where it rocks and where it sucks.

## Mobile vs Desktop

> slide

First of all lets take a look how mobile world is different
from good old desktop environmet.

* touch, gestures and small screen -> different UX patterns
* performance
  * execution is slow
  * memory is scarce
  * 3G network is sluggish
* WebKit dominated browser landscape
  We are lucky here, it's mainly WebKit browsers.
  Well, there is Windows Phone on the horizon
  with astonishing less than 1% market share in Australia.

## Mobile Libraries & Frameworks

Now lets take a look which libraries are here to make our life easier.

* Sencha Touch
* jQuery + jQuery Mobile + ...
* Zepto.js + ...
* Micro libraries like iScroll
* ...

This list is sorted from top to bottom by amount of features that libraries provide.
Obviously nothing comes without price so library's size increases in the same order.

##  Why Sencha Touch Rocks?

Class System and MVC

  * inheritance, mixins, statics, singleton
  * automatic dependency management
  * standart application architecture
  * declarative selector based event binding
  * deep linking support (routing)

Rich Set of Components

  * lists and forms - look and feel close to native
  * toolbars, buttons and icons
  * tabs, carousel and overlays
  * awesome charts (separate component)

More Goodness

* Core utils: DOM manipulations, selectors, platform detection, templates etc
* theming framework based on SASS and Compass
* commandline tools: scaffolds, build & packaging

## Why Sencha Touch Sucks?

> slide

* supports only iOS, Android and Blackberry at the moment
* complex: learning curve can be high
* heavy: for example 420/142Kb - JS, 133/65Kb - CSS
* not on GitHub

## How to Study

> slide

* Guides, videos and samples
* Samples: KitchenSink
* API docs & source code
* Blog, forum & Twitter
  minor version updates
