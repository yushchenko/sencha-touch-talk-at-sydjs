# Notes

## Me
A mobile web developer working for Fairfax.

## Two humble goals
Short overview of Sencha Touch framework.
Make a decision if you need it for your next project.
And if so make you way a little bit easier.

## Mobile vs Desktop
Touch + small screen -> different UX patterns
Performance: rendering, memory and network
Different environments -> browser vs native wrapper

## Mobile Libraries & Frameworks
Sencha Touch
jQuery + jQuery Mobile + Backbone.js
Zepto.js + Backbone.js
Micro libraries like iScroll
...

##  Why Sencha Touch Rocks? (What Sencha Touch gives you?)
class system - classes, inheritance and mixins, dependency management
MVC and application structure
rich set of standard components
utils - DOM, Selectors, Templates etc
tool chain - scaffolds, build, deployment
theming framework

## Why Sencha Touch Sucks?
complex - learning curve is high especially for frontend developers
heavy

## How to Study
tutorial + videos
samples - KitchenSink
API documentation
Source code - not on GitHub
Forum

## Add More Coffeine
CoffeeScript
debugging

## Wrap Up

## Thanks
