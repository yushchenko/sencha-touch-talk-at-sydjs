Sencha Touch + Your Next Project === Love?

## Introduction

> slide

Hi, my name is Valery. 
I am JavaScript developer like many of you.
A half a year ago I decided to find out how mobile web development looks like
and now I would like to share some of this findings with you.

In Fairfax, the company where I work,
some not particularly technical people call me a 'Sencha developer'.
It sounds ridiculous, in the same way one can address a carpenter as a 'hammer operator'.
What I am trying to convey is that a framework or library
is just a tool to make your job done.

Starting a new project you hopefully have a choice which tools to pick up.
Lets try to find out weather you need Sencha Touch and where it rocks and where it sucks.

## Mobile vs Desktop

> slide

First of all lets take a look how mobile world is different
from good old desktop environmet.

* touch, gestures and small screen -> different UX patterns
* performance
  * execution is slow
  * memory is scarce
  * 3G network is sluggish
* WebKit dominated browser landscape
  We are lucky here, it's mainly WebKit browsers.
  Well, there is Windows Phone on the horizon
  with astonishing less than 1% market share in Australia.
* app should work in different environments: browser + native wrapper

## Mobile Libraries & Frameworks

Now lets take a look which libraries are here to make our life easier.

* Sencha Touch
* jQuery + jQuery Mobile + ...
* Zepto.js + ...
* Micro libraries like iScroll
* ...

This list is sorted from top to bottom by amount of features that libraries provide.
Obviously nothing comes without price so library's size increases in the same order.

##  Why Sencha Touch Rocks?

> slide

Class System and MVC

  * inheritance + mixins
  * statics and singelton
  * automatic dependency management

  * standart application architecture
  * declarative selector based event binding
  * declarative support for deep linking (routing)
  * profiles to support different layout for phones and tablets

Rich set of standard components

  * list and forms - look and feel close to native
  * toolbars, buttons andicons
  * tabs, carousel and overlays
  * awesome charts (separate component)

> slide

Utils
  DOM manipulations, Selectors, Templates etc

* theming framework
* tool chain - scaffolds, build, deployment

## Why Sencha Touch Sucks?

* supports only iOS, Android and Blackberry at the moment
* complex - learning curve is high especially for jQuery developers
* heavy
* GPL/Commertial - not MIT
* not on GitHub

## How to Study

* tutorial + videos
* samples - KitchenSink
* API documentation
* Source code - not on GitHub
* Forum/twitter - minor version updates

## Hello Sencha

* scaffolds with sencha command
* Ext.Component + Ext.Container
* routing
* event handling

## Add More Coffeine

Using CoffeeScript with ST.

## Wrap Up

## Thanks
